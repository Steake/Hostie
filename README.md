Hostie
======

A simple cli hosts file editor for MacOS X 

To use read the install readme in the /bin directory.
-----------------------------------------------------

#It is reccomended that you use xCode and the hostie.xcodeproj file at all times. 

All actual file handling is done from TFStringHandlers.m
The main.m file handles the CLI interface and the argc etc...

Code is uncommented, if you like the project please feel free to fork away
